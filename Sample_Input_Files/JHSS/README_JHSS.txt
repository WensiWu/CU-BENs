README_model: This folder contains the input file of a ship hull (JHSS). The ship hull is modeled with 91,776 DKT shell elements. The model is constrained in rotations as well as y- and z- direction. Nonlinear pressure pulse loading is prescribed on the stern. The total time of this analysis is 0.012 sec, divided into 30 equal time steps. This is a first order elastic analysis that uses the Newmark implicit time integration scheme. 

Usage:

Move input file to same folder as all other source code files. 

Rename input file to “model_def.txt”.
